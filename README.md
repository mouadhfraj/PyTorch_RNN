# Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) Implementation with PyTorch

This project is a deep dive into Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), specifically focusing on implementing a simple RNN using PyTorch. While we're not building an RNN entirely from scratch (we use PyTorch's autograd for gradient computations and backpropagation), this hands-on approach still provides valuable insights into the inner workings of RNNs.

## Introduction to RNNs
Recurrent Neural Networks are a type of neural network architecture ideal for sequential data, such as time series or natural language. Unlike traditional feedforward networks, RNNs have connections that form cycles within the network, allowing information to persist. This feature makes them well-suited for tasks that involve data sequences, like text generation, language translation, and speech recognition.



## Project Overview
This repository aims to implement a simple RNN in PyTorch. The steps include:
1. **Data Preprocessing** - Preparing and cleaning the data.
2. **Model Creation** - Building an RNN layer-by-layer in PyTorch.
3. **Training** - Implementing backpropagation through time (BPTT) using PyTorch autograd.
4. **Evaluation** - Assessing the performance of the model on sample sequential data.

### Key Topics Covered:
- Understanding the basics of RNNs and their applications
- Building and training a simple RNN from scratch in PyTorch
- Using autograd for gradient computations and backpropagation
